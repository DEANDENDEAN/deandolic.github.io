<img src="figure2.jpg" alt="Post Image" width="300">

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul="disc">
   <li>Pizza dough (you can buy ready-made or prepare at home)</li>
   <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce or pepperoni</li>
   <li>200 g grated cheese (e.g. mozzarella)</li>

   <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>First, prepare the pizza dough. If you are using ready-made pizza dough, follow the instructions on the package. If you want to make homemade dough, use the recipe of your choice.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to the highest possible temperature (usually around 230 Â°C) and prepare a baking tray that you have lightly greased.</li>
<li>On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into the desired shape (round, rectangular, etc.). Place it on the prepared baking tray.</li>
<li>Spread the tomato sauce or pelata evenly over the dough, leaving a border.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the grated cheese over the sauce.</li>
<li>Place the slices of prosciutto over the cheese.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough is crisp and the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>
<li>While the pizza is baking, wash and dry the rocket.</li>
<li>When the pizza is cooked, remove it from the oven and leave it to cool slightly.</li>
<li>Arrange the fresh rocket on top of the pizza.</li>
<li>Drizzle with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
<li>Add freshly ground black pepper, if desired.</li>
<li>Slice the pizza and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>

This recipe will allow you to enjoy the taste of salty prosciutto, soft cheese and fresh rocket on crispy pizza dough. Enjoy your homemade ham pizza!
