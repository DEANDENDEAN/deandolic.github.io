                <p>Ingredients:</p>

      <ul="disc">

          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 cup BBQ sauce (you can buy pre-made or make it at home)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of brown sugar</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of mustard</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of onion powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of smoked paprika</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Instructions:</p>

     <ol type="1">
        <li>Heat the oven to 180 Â°C.</li>
        <li>Wash the pork ribs and dry them with paper towels. Remove excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper the ribs to taste.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the BBQ sauce, brown sugar, mustard, apple cider vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and smoked paprika.</li>
        <li>Place the pork ribs in a large roasting pan or on a wire rack set over a roasting pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After one hour, brush the ribs with BBQ sauce and return them to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for another 30-45 minutes, occasionally basting the ribs with additional BBQ sauce. The fish should be soft and fall away from the bones.</li>
        <li>When the ribs are cooked, remove them from the oven and cover them with foil. Let them rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the ribs into individual pieces and serve with the remaining BBQ sauce.</li>
