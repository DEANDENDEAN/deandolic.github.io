		<p>Here's a simple recipe for a classic pie:</p>

                <p>Ingredients:</p>

     <ul="disc">
        <li>250 g of flour</li>
        <li>125 g butter (cold, cut into cubes)</li>
        <li>4-6 tablespoons of ice cold water</li>
     Ingredients for the filling:<br><br>
        <li>3 cups filling of your choice (sliced fruit)</li>
        <li>For the sweet pie: sugar, cinnamon, vanilla sugar to taste</li>
     </ul>

      <p>Instructions:</p>


    <ol type="1">
      <li>We start by preparing the dough. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the sliced butter and mix with your hands until it becomes crumbly.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the ice cold water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork or hands until the dough begins to come together.</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead until smooth and uniform. Shape it into a disc, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling of your choice. Prepare and season sliced fruit, vegetables, meat or cheese as desired. Add sugar, cinnamon and vanilla sugar to sweet pies, and salt, pepper and spices to savory pies.</li>
      <li>Heat the oven to 180 Â°C.</li>
      <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it out on a floured surface into the desired shape and size that fits your baking pan.</li>
      <li>Place the rolled dough in the pan and press the sides to fit well. Trim the excess dough.</li>
      <li>Spread the prepared filling evenly over the dough in the baking pan.</li>
      <li>If you like, you can use the remaining dough to make ribbons or other patterns on top of the pie for decoration.</li>
      <li>Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the dough is golden and the filling is soft and bubbly.</li>
      <li>When the pie is baked, take it out of the oven and let it cool a bit before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve warm or chilled, you can add ice cream, whipped cream or dressing if you like.</li>

    </ol>
