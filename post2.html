		<p>Here is a recipe for baked octopus with potatoes:</p>

                <p>Ingredients:</p>

                <ul="disc">
                     <li>medium-sized fresh octopus (about 1.5 kg)</li>
                     <li>500 g small potatoes (preferably golden or red variety)</li>
                     <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
                     <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
                     <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
                     <li>Fresh herbs to taste (e.g. parsley, thyme, rosemary)</li>
                     <li>Salt</li>
                     <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>

      <p>Instructions:</p>

             <ol type="1">

         <li>Wash the octopus well under running cold water to remove any remaining sand or dirt. Cut off the head and intestines and remove the skin. Also clean the eyes and beak.</li>
         <li>Boil water in a pot. When the water boils, reduce the heat to medium and submerge the octopus in the water for a few seconds. This will help the skin to come off more easily. Repeat the process of dipping into the boiling water a few more times.</li>
         <li>After dipping, drain the octopus and pat it dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.</li>
         <li>Put water in a large pot and salt it. When the water boils, add the octopus and cook on low heat for about 45-60 minutes until tender. Cooking time depends on the size of the octopus, so test it with a fork to make sure it's tender.</li>
         <li>While the octopus is cooking, wash the small potatoes and boil them in salted water until they are almost cooked but still firm. Drain them.</li>
         <li>Mix olive oil, chopped garlic, lemon juice, freshly chopped herbs, salt and pepper in a bowl.</li>
         <li>When the octopus is cooked, remove it from the pot and cut it into small pieces.</li>
         <li>Place the boiled potatoes and sliced octopus in the baking dish. Pour over the mixture of olive oil, garlic, herbs and spices and stir to evenly coat the ingredients.</li>
         <li>Heat the oven to 220 Â°C. Place the baking dish with the octopus and potatoes in the heated oven.</li>
         <li>Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden brown and crispy.</li>
         <li>Once cooked, remove from oven. If desired, you can sprinkle with fresh chopped herbs.</li>
         <li>Serve warm as a main course. You can supplement it with lemon slices or a dressing based on olive oil and lemon.</li>
       
           </ol>

<p>This recipe for baked octopus with potatoes will create a delicious dish where delicious and tender octopus is intertwined with crispy potatoes. Enjoy your meal!</p>
